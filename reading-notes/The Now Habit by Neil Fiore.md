## Introduction

* **The vicious cycle**:

    > **get overwhelmed** → feel pressured → fear failure → try harder → work longer → feel resentful → lose motivation → **procrastinate**

    * Starts with the pressure of **feeling overwhelmed**
    * Ends with **procrastination** – the attempt to **escape the pressure**
    * Cannot enjoy the recuperative and creative benefits of guilt-free leisure time; time on playing or most enjoyable work feels like uneasy shrinking of what you _should_ be doing
* **A new definition of procrastination:**

    > Procrastination is a mechanism for **coping with the anxiety** associated with starting or completing any task or decision.
* **The Now Habit**: put aside the fear of failure, the terror of feeling overwhelmed and low self-esteem, and focus on your mind on what you can start _now_.
    * Core idea: **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life**
        * **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life** can attack the underlying causes of procrastination by **lowering resentment toward work**, **making it easier to start working**, **improving the quality of work**, and **stirring motivation**.
    * **Ten powerful tools to use:**
        1. Creating safety
        2. Reprogramming negative attitudes through positive self-talk
        3. Using the symptom to trigger the cure
        4. Guilt-free play
        5. Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar
        6. Making worry work for you
        7. The Unschedule
        8. Setting realistic goals
        9. Working in the flow state
        10. Controlled setbacks

## Chapter 1: Why We Procrastinate

### Warning Signs of Procrastination

1. Long series of obligations that cannot be met
2. Unrealistic about time
3. Vague about goals and values
4. Unfulfilled, frustrated, depressed
5. Indecisive and afraid of being criticized for mistakes
6. Low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness

### A Positive View of the Human Spirit

* ❌ Procrastination is not from laziness, disorganization or other character defect.
* ✅ Procrastination is a mechanism **self-defending**: the **fear of failure**, the **fear of being imperfect (perfectionism)**, and the **fear of impossible expectations (being overwhelmed)** that prevent us from acting on and attaining humanly possible goals and relationships.

### Our Worst Critics: Ourselves

* In childhood we are often criticized that we are _ever good enough_. We faced criticism or constructive feedback for parents.
* This leeds to low self-esteem and negative attitudes towards work.
* ✅ We have to reconstruct our confidence and get rid of our worst critic: _ourselves_. By doing this we can lessen resistance to authority, fear of failure, perfectionism, and fear of success.

### Procrastination is Rewarding

* ❗ Many ways delaying is used to solve problems:
    * Make postponed tasks completed by someone else
    * Hesitant on buying something – the item is eventually going on sale or going out of style
    * Procrastination often goes unpunished
    * Cool down to avoid serious arguments with parents, teachers, bosses, and friends
    * Difficult problems often resolve by themselves if you wait for additional information of allow opportunities to pass
* ❗ The pernicious cycle:

    > Perfectionistic demands lead to → fear of failure → **procrastination** → self-criticism → anxiety and depression → loss of confidence → greater fear of failure which leads to → stronger need to use **procrastination** as a temporary escape

    * We are reluctant to face challenges and take risks without self-protective defenses. If you believe that a judgment of your work is a judgment of you, then perfectionism, self-criticism, and procrastination are necessary forms of **protection**.
    * We can become addicted to the rewards of procrastination, and use it in three main ways:
        1. as an indirect way of resisting pressure from authorities;
        2. as a way of lessening fear of failure by providing an excuse for a disappointing, less-than-perfect performance;
        3. and as a defense against fear of success by keeping us from doing our best.
* ❗ Procrastination is usually not the problem itself, but rather a symptom of other underlying problems.
    * **Procrastination can express resentment**
        * You are aware of the consequence of anger and punishment from powerful authorities.
        * If you are in a one-down position — a student, a subordinate, a private in the army — procrastination may be the safest way to exercise some power and control over your life.
    * **Procrastination is often used against fear of failure**
        * If you maintain extremely high standards for your performance and are critical of your mistakes, you will need to defend yourself from risky projects where the chances of failure are high.
        * Perfectionism and self-criticism are, in fact, the chief causes of fear of failure.
    * **Procrastination is often used to keep you from facing your fear of success**
        * Fear of success involves three central issues:
            1. **Conflict**: you find yourself in conflict over the awful choice between advancement and friends;
            2. **Disincentives**: success in completing a project means facing some painful disincentives to success, such as moving, looking for a new job, or paying back student loans; and
            3. **Delayed Fear of Failure**: success means advancement to increasing demands and a fear of ultimate failure sometime in the future.
        * You will reach a point where you can no longer make yourself do what you've been telling yourself you have to do to maintain success. **Your motivation had dried up. You can't seem to push yourself anymore.**
* **Procrastination is learned, and can be unlearned.** To unlearn procrastination, you need to:
    * Understand underlying causes of procrastination;
    * Develop alternative tools to cope with your fears, make work less painful and less depriving;
    * Make work more enjoyable, and make the quality and pleasure of leisure time greater than what you can ever achieve by procrastinating.

## Chapter 2: How We Procrastinate

### Knowing How You Spend Your Time

* ✅ Observe where your time is going. Record the amount of time spent on your work and life. Create a schedule.
* ✅ Categorize your activities:
    * A: Most important
    * B: Important
    * C: Least important
* ❗ Urgent things are not always the best uses of our time.
* ✅ Keep recording for a few days so that you have a better estimate on how you spent on your time. Review how you spent your time. Then you can find areas of improvement – reducing time on unimportant activities.
    * Example: Get out of bed immediately; spend less time on breakfast; eliminate time spent on TV in the morning and evening when you are pressed for time.
    * Example: If you are a person taking long time to "settle in" before getting started, make conscious choices when you enter the office in the morning.
* ❗ Most of the time you spent are not directly related to high-priority tasks. Look for areas of improvement and gain greater control over interruptions and lost time.

### The Procrastination Log

* ❗Keeping a record of how you spent your time will alert you how you inefficiently used your time, but it will not provide cues for you in actual work situation that need a change in your focus if you want to avoid falling back to your old behavior.
* ❗By _recording_ your current behavior and thoughts, you can know where to take corrective actions. Otherwise you are unable to learn from your past mistakes. The **procrastination log** provides as system that is easier for you to gain control of your time and your behavior patterns.
* ❗Your procrastination log can alert you to the _types_ of situations in which you are most likely to procrastinate. Examples:
    1. Detail activities
    2. Home chores
    3. Performance tasks
    4. Big or dense projects
* ✅ Identify the fears and pressures you typically associate with certain types of projects. The procrastination logs can show you how it helps or hinders your goal achievement. Awareness of the inner dialogue about how it connects to your procrastination patterns will let you make use of the now habit strategy.

### Creating Safety: The First Major Step Out of Procrastination

* ❗ Your mind often changes when you face some kind of danger, depending on whether the danger is immediate and real or just possible. Procrastination usually occurs when you use fear to cover up yourself from the pressure of a real deadline.
* ❗ Procrastination and anxiety works in five stages:
    1. You give a task or a goal the power to determine your worth and happiness;
    2. You use perfectionism to put yourself in a situation where a single mistake will result in the _end of the world_;
    3. You find yourself of _frozen with anxiety_;
    4. You then use procrastination to escape the dilemma between _the immediate, and frightening_ **fear of failure** when doing the work, and the _higher level of anxiety_ from **time pressure of deadlines**;
    5. You then use a **real threat** such as fire or deadline to release yourself and perfectionism and to act as a motivator.

> If you maintain perfectionist standards, then failing to achieve your goals or making a mistake can feel as if you're going to die. But maybe your job, your relationship, or your home is so important to you that losing it would feel like the end of the world. If so, you'll want to know how to create alternatives that allow you to bounce back from your natural procrastination patterns.
>
> **In order to maximize your performance in a stressful world, you must create a protected and indisputable sense of worth for yourself.** Until you do, energy and concentration will be drained from work and put into preparing for imagined threats to your survival, and into procrastination as a means of coping.
>
> If you are threatening yourself with self-hatred and a life of unhappiness unless you achieve your goal, it's impossible to concentrate on the work in front of you now. **You must have some sort of protection from these self-imposed threats. Your healthy survival response (commonly thought of as stress) will not stop until you are safe.** You need a commitment to yourself and your innate worth that lets you know that, in spite of any failures, you believe in yourself enough to **try again, to get back on this board** – or some other board more suited to your unique talents.

## Chapter 3: How to Talk to Yourself

### Counterproductive Messages

* ❗ When we speak to ourselves in an authoritarian voice, it indicates that we feel pressure to do something, and that while one part of ourselves is applying the pressure, the other part does not want to do it. Such self-alienation and subconscious message of such self-talk leads to inner conflict and procrastination of ourselves.
* ✅ To heal self-alienation and inner conflict between the authoritarian voice and rebel, we have to learn a language that removes such conflict and gains power over ourselves.
* Counterproductive messages drive you away from the positive direction towards what you _want, decide, or choose_ to do.
    * ❌ Counterproductive messages:
        * **The "have to's"** – messages of stress
            * You don't want to do something and you feel that external forces are pushing you towards doing them.
            * A "have to" statement communicates to your subconscious mind:

                > * I don't want to do it.
                > * They're making me do it against my will.
                > * I have to do it or else!—something awful and terrible will happen. I will hate myself.
                > * This is a no-win situation: if I don't do it I'll be punished; if I do it I'll be going against myself.
            * You are stuck _mentally, physically, and emotionally_ when you face the confusion of the "have to" message, as you brain provides energy both to the imposed task and to resist threats to the integrity of yourself.
        * **The "should's"** – messages of depression
            * You feel angry and disappointed about the situation, and you complain and feel badly.
            * Self-critical comparisons:

                | Criticism | Compares | With |
                |-----------|----------|------|
                | **Should be different** | An imagined ideal state | A current negative reality |
                | **Should be done** | The finished point | A bad or negative starting point |
                | **Should be like him/her** | A person you envy or admire | A bad, inadequate self |
                | **Should be there** | An imagined blissful future | Where you are now |

    * ❌ "Have to's: and "should do's" do not communicate to the mind and body a clear picture of:

        > * _What you choose_ to do
        > * _When you choose_ to do it
        > * _Where you choose_ to start it
        > * _How you choose_ to do it
* ✅ As you speak to yourself in a language focusing on results rather than blame, on choice rather than _have to_, on _what is_ rather than what you think _should be_, you feel that your mind and body cooperate by providing positive energy that release you from the unnecessary struggles of the past and negative comparisons with the future.

### The Power of Choice

* ✅ **From resistance to commitment**
    * You don't have to _want_ or _love_ to do the task, but if you prefer it to the consequences of not doing it, you can decide to _commit_ it wholeheartedly.
    * ✅ **Since you made a mature commitment to the task rather than arguing against it, you may as well be self-nurturing to make it as pleasant as possible.**
* ✅ **Learning how to say no**
    * For procrastinators, saying "no" is a powerful tool for exercising choice.
    * "No" can be used assertively and non-defensively:

        > * "No, I'll need time to think about that."
        > * "No, I am not as quick as you, and I want time to give it the thoughtful consideration it deserves."
        > * "No, I would rather have a contract with terms I know I can wholeheartedly embrace than endanger the quality of my work by compromising."
        > * "No, I will not be paying that bill now, and I'm willing to pay for the privilege by incurring your interest charges."
    * ✅ **Developing fresh alternative self-statements that involve choice, commitment, and the ability to say no is an essential step toward having a greater range of possibilities in working on any task and in changing from a procrastinator to an effective producer.**

### Five Self-Statements That Distinguish Procrastinators From Producers

* ✅ As you switch from the old, negative thinkings to the new and positive thinkings, the old ones will atrophy, and the new ones will become strengthen and easier to start with.
* ✅ Practice shifting to the effective self-talks of producers. You can place them everywhere most visible and accessible to you.

    | # | Negative thinking of… | → | Replace with… |
    |---|-----------------------|---|---------------|
    | 1 | "I have to" | → | "I choose to" |
    | 2 | "I must finish" | → | "When can I start?" |
    | 3 | "This project is so big and important" | → | "I can take one small step" |
    | 4 | "I must be perfect" | → | "I can be perfectly human" |
    | 5 | "I don't have time to play" | → | "I must take time to play" |

## Chapter 4: Guilt-Free Play, Quality Work

* Most tragic form of procrastination – **putting off living**
    * ❌ Keeps us from completing the most important tasks in life;
    * ❌ Lessens our respect for ourselves by keeping use in destructive, delaying tactics such as overeating, excessive TV watching, the investment of time and money in a succession of halfhearted and rapidly abandoned hobbies and schemes.
* ❗ Both workaholics and procrastinators tend to:
    * See themselves as always **burdened by incomplete work**
    * Thinking the lives of themselves as "**being on hold**" hoping that someday they will be organized enough to enjoy life
    * View human beings as lazy and requiring pressure in order to create motivation
    * Maintain negative attitudes toward work
* ❗ **Both workaholics and procrastinators are either working or feeling guilty about not working.**

### The Importance of Play

* **Guilt-free play** is essential to attaining quality work and minimizing procrastination. When you apply this strategy, you learn to _play more and complete more quality work_.
* ❌ Long-term procrastinators _suffered more_ when they take a long time to complete their work. They:
    * Saw themselves as always working
    * Thought of their lives as "being on hold"
    * Felt that work required deprivation and sacrifice
    * Felt guilty if they spent time with their friends or in leisure activities
* ✅ On the other hand, those who made good progress and completed their goals timely were dedicated and committed to their _leisure time_.
    * They had to swim, run, or dance almost every day.
    * They met with friends frequently on dinners.
    * They _recreate_ themselves to keep them motivated and interested in returning to their projects.
* ❗ One reason we procrastinate is that we fear the we have no time to play once we start working, and that work will deprive us of the pleasure of play and the enjoyment of life. **Guilt-free play offers you an alternative way that it insists you to schedule recreation time in your weekly schedule. Making play a priority in your life is an important way to overcome procrastination and to enjoy life more.**
* ❗ Adults usually think of play as being separate from learning and work. But play is an essential part of every child's development and learning about work, **allowing them to learn the physical, mental and social skills necessary for adult life**.
* ✅ **Guilt-free play can revive your early excitement about learning, problem-solving, and participating in challenging activities.**

### The Pull Method of Self-Motivation

* ❗ **Push method** – stimulate actions through fear and punishment.
    * Action produced by punishment does not directed towards the goal, but directed towards escaping the fear.
    * The push method assumes that humans are lazy and scaring the hell out of them may create motivation.
* ✅ **Pull method** – stimulate actions through rewards and achievements.
    * The pull method assumes that we are naturally inquisitive, and if we are properly rewarded for our efforts we can persevere with even the most difficult tasks.
    * The pull method recognize that _distant and indefinite_ rewards have very little power to motivate a person to continually face difficult, overwhelming tasks.
    * ❗ There is a low chance you will start working on a task if the immediate results are isolation and pain, and the rewards are distant and uncertain. Chances of choosing this kind of activities are even slimmer.
    * ✅ Finding some time to do things you really love to do can lessen the sense of burden and deprivation from working.

### From Guilt-Free Play to Quality Work

* ✅ **Enjoying guilt-free play leads to you to higher levels of quality, creative work.**
* Once you have completed some quality work, your feeling of self-control increases, and your capacity to enjoy _quality, guilt-free play_ grows. The seeds of earlier work also flourish subconsciously into new ideas and breakthroughs. You then become better rested, inspired, and ready for _greater quality work_.
* As you include guilt-free play among your tools for overcoming procrastination, you will find that insights come to you throughout your day.
* ✅ Emphasizing the importance of play does not deny the need of work and perseverance. It recognizes the importance of work, but it also recognizes play as a _commitment to a mission_ that focuses your energies and brings about inner harmony, a commitment that comes from a pull _toward_ a goal, and an excitement about the process of getting there.

## Chapter 5: Overcoming Blocks to Action

* Suffering from harsh criticism from yourself, parents, teachers, and friends for doing less-than-perfect work or for not knowing how to solve problems that are easy in others' eyes, you may have develop the tendency to avoid certain types of work.
* Procrastination, by enabling you to avoid what you fear, is a phobic response to work associated with worry, struggle, failure, and anxiety. If procrastination is your sole self-defense, it will be difficult for you to unlearn it.
* You need three major tools to cope with procrastination and fear: **three-dimensional thinking**, **the work of worrying**, and **persistent starting**.

### Three Major Blocks

* ✅ The three Now Habit tools:
    1. **Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar**, to combat the terror of being overwhelmed
        * It is natural to have some anxiety when you face the work needed to complete a project. This normal level of anxiety will not become overwhelming unless you:
            1. Insist on knowing the one _right_ place to start.
            2. Have not permitted yourself time along the course of your project for learning, building confidence with each step, and asking for help.
            3. Are critical of the fact that you're _only_ starting, and you tell yourself, "I should be finished."
        * Use the **reverse calendar** to see what you can tackle, where you can delegate, and when you'll have a chance to catch your breath. You should use it _immediately_ if you feel overwhelmed.
            * The reverse calendar starts from the **ultimate deadline**, moves back step-by-step, and ends at the present where you can focus your energy on starting.
    2. **The work of worrying**, to tackle the fear of failure and the fear of being imperfect
        * Ask yourself the six questions as a part of work worrying:
            1. **What is the worst that could happen?** → Acknowledge the most dreaded scenario.
            2. **What would I do if the worst really happened?** → Consider where you can get help and what to do. Build confidence that there is nothing so terrible to stop yourself.
            3. **How would I lessen the pain and get on with as much happiness as possible if the worst did occur?** → Forgiving yourself for being human, vulnerable, and imperfect. Remember your strengths so that you can use them to tackle challenges.
            4. **What alternatives would I have?** → Consider alternatives of your life. Remember that you have many ways to be happy and successful.
            5. **What can I do now to lessen the probability of this dreaded event occurring?** → Tackle the problem in the ways that increase your chance of success by reducing the probabilities of the worst things to happen.
            6. **Is there anything I can do now to increase my chance of achieving my goal?** → Establish a sense of safety that even in the worst situation you have alternatives. You are prepared to do the best without worrying about failure.
        * By using the work of worrying, creating safety, and using the language of the producer, you are establishing the skills for maintaining genuine self-confidence. You know whether you are calm or anxious, whether you succeed or fail, and you will do your best and be prepared to carry on and try again if necessary. You know that you are _prepared for the worst_ and you can _focus on the work_ that will lead to the _best_.
    3. **Persistent starting**, to tackle fear of not finishing
        * Prepare challenges to negative statements and attitudes:
            1. **"I need to do more preparation before I can start."** → Make real contributions towards completing your work. Gain feedback so that you will be ascertain on what you have completed. Take _one more step forward_.
            2. **"At this rate I'll never finish."** → Create a positive expectation and then you will have your large jumps in your learning and ability.
            3. **"I should have started earlier."** → Break the project into sections, along with breaks and planned vacations in-between. Keep your commitment to guilt-free play. Reward yourself every step of progress.
            4. **"There's only more work after this."** → Avoid feelings of "have to" and fear for future work that have not yet took place. Keep in mind that you are in control of when you face the next step of work, and that you will be stronger after you complete the current step.
            5. **"It's not working."** → Do not regard difficulties and failures as the sign to give up, but a signal for you to be creative and to tackle around the problem. Focus on the _desired results_ and make your path of work work towards the goal.
            6. **"I only need a little more time."** → Learn to tolerate the anxiety and risks of finishing, even though you know your work isn't perfect. Learn to cope with criticism by taking your ego off the line. Use the three tools to prepare yourself to deal with anticipated criticism and necessary corrections.
        * **Keep on starting.** Use these strategies to conquer your fear of being overwhelmed, fear of failure, and fear of finishing.

## Chapter 6: The Unschedule

### Even Producers Need a System

* ❗ System of goal achievement:
    * Guilt-free play
    * Quality work
    * The Unschedule
* ✅ **The Unschedule** plays these roles:
    * Weekly calendar of recreational activities
    * Integrates several well-organized behavioral and psychological principles in an innovative way to address procrastination and improve productivity and creativity
    * Builds confidence in two ways:
        1. It gives you immediate and frequent rewards following short periods of work
        2. Gives you visible reward that allows you to see how much concentrated, uninterrupted work you have completed each day and each week

### Reverse Psychology

* ✅ **Unschedule: _put more time into leisure and more quality into your work_**
    * Do not work more than twenty hours a week on this project.
    * Do not work more than five hours a day on this project.
    * You _must_ exercise, play, or dance at least one hour a day.
    * You _must_ take at least one day a week off from any work.
    * Aim for starting on thirty minutes of quality work.
    * Work for an imperfect, perfectly human first effort.
    * Start small.
* ❗ This strategy _reverses_ those fears of being overwhelmed and of failure and turns them into **powerful tools for developing the Now Habit**.

### How to Use the Unschedule

* ✅ Guidelines for filling in your Unschedule:
    1. Schedule only:
        * previously committed time such as meals, sleep, meetings
        * free time, recreation, leisure reading
        * socializing, lunches and dinners with friends
        * health activities such as swimming, running, tennis, working out at the gym
        * routine structured events such as commuting time, classes, medical appointments
    2. Fill in your Unschedule with work on projects only after you have completed at least one-half hour.
    3. Take credit only for periods of work that represent at least thirty minutes of uninterrupted work.
    4. Reward yourself with a break or a change to a more enjoyable task after each period worked.
    5. Keep track of the number of quality hours worked each day and each week.
    6. Always leave at least one full day a week for recreation and any small chores you wish to take care of.
    7. Before deciding to go to a recreational activity or social commitment, take time out for just thirty minutes of work on your project.
    8. Focus on starting.
    9. Think small.
    10. Keep starting.
    11. Never end "down."
* ✅ Use a personal organizer to note down your activities.
    * Use different colors for different activities. Color-coding your activities will help you quickly see important patterns in your daily activities.
    * Note the times in which you work best and the days for which you need to focus on starting earlier.
    * A common pattern is a slump following a period of intense work. You might observe that after several eight-hour days of uninterrupted work with no breaks on the weekend, you lose a whole week to procrastination or illness.

### Adjusting Your Unschedule

* ❗ Some important factors to consider when you use unschedule:
    * You're probably busier than you thought.
    * Certain days are less productive than others.
    * Other days are so busy that you need to lower your expectations on getting started on a big project.
    * Even a half-hour of work on your project is enough to maintain momentum and avoid the extra burden of having to overcome inertia tomorrow.
* ✅ Using the unschedule provides five major benefits that lead to greater enjoyment of guilt-free play and overcoming procrastination:
    1. **Realistic timekeeping**: Record the time commitment by yourself allows you to see how much time is really left for working towards your goals.
    2. **Thirty minutes of quality time**: Aiming at _starting_ (rather than finishing) for thirty minutes allows you to feel less overwhelmed. Also, being focused every half-hour allows you to get something done or at least get organized, so the next time of starting will be easier for you.
    3. **Experiencing success**: Scheduling rewards or alternative activities allows you to feel the progress rather than failure to meet an unrealistic schedule, and lessens your deprivation from work and let you experience work as something that gives you pride and allows you to fully enjoy your leisure time.
    4. **Self-imposed deadlines**: Setting internal deadlines by yourself allows you to gain self-control over what you are doing, and maintain commitment to your health, friends, or other to-do list items _without guilt_.
    5. **Newfound "free-time"**: By pre-scheduling your leisure activities, you would see that when one of them is cancelled, you have free time to work. You also experience a wonderful and surprising sense of motivation to get something started. You may also discover that you may want to do some new work using the free time.

## Chapter 7: Working in the Flow State

* We all experience daily shifts of consciousness into natural levels of calm, focused energy and attention.
    * Our ability to concentrate improves so we are able to focus on one topic, screening out extraneous stimuli, and are less likely to be distracted by the fears and worries that lead to procrastination.
    * During these special states, our tolerance for noise and pain is higher than usual, while the pulse rate, blood pressure, and heart rate are lower, and metabolism is more efficient.
    * It's a healthier state, in which our ability to perform athletic or creative tasks and solve problems increases.
* ❗ Definition of **flow state**: "reflecting an inner state that is both intensely focused and exceptionally calm."

### Using More of Your Brain

* ❗ You can tell that your critical functions are getting in the way of your creative side if you hear yourself saying:

    > * "But is this the right direction?"
    > * "Will it be good enough?"
    > * "What if the boss/teacher/audience isn't happy with it?"
    > * "Can I do it?"
    > * "I have to finish soon."
    > * "When will I ever learn to start earlier?"
    > * "There's so much to do."
* For you to work rapidly and creatively, you left and right hemispheres of your brain must cooperate together.
    * **Left hemisphere**: responsible for critical and logical functions
    * **Right hemisphere**: responsible for creative functions
    * The left hemisphere must be temporarily be suspended to allow the right hemisphere to start the flow of ideas and inspirations that you need. Later your left side can organize them to fit the projects of the customer.

### It's Only Your First Draft

* ✅ We need to temporarily suspend the criticism and linear thought when we start a new project. We also need to protect the early renderings of our projects from the overly critical comparison with the ideal, ultimate goal.
* Even the great writers and artists undergo a nonlinear, seemingly disorganized creative process we experience when we start a new project.

### Learning to Focus

* ✅ Regardless of how you feel, within two minutes you will be focused, curious, motivated, and creative. And, most important of all, you will have started – and be on your way to finishing.
    * The two-minute procedure shifts your mind rapidly to the flow state by replacing guilt and stress with a stress-free focus on the presence.
    * It is purposefully short so that you can integrate it throughout your busy day, instead of spending some dedicated time to practice it.

### Focusing Exercise

* ✅ Focus on breathing. Release your muscle tensions. Keep these ideas in mind when doing the focusing exercise:
    1. Letting go of the past
    2. Letting go of the future
    3. Centering in the present

### Relaxation Exercise

* ✅ Close your eyes. Take deep breath.

### Incorporating Flow States Into Your Program

* ✅ **Working in the flow state** or _in the zone_ removes the emotional need to procrastinate and accelerates your progress toward your goals. It will also complement your other Now Habit tools and will eliminate most, if not all, of the negative habits that kept you procrastinating. It will replace them with positive work attitudes and habits that turn work into an opportunity for exciting, focused, and creative achievement.

## Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Progress

### Planned Setbacks

* Completely transforming from your old habits to a new, more productive behavior pattern needs trying to tackle difficult or tempting situations. However, you do not need to totally eliminate your old behavior in order to learn the new one. Instead, you may use familiar patterns to alert you to exercise the new choices you have.
* ✅ You may **plan a controlled setback** to strengthen your ability to switch from the old behavior to the new one.
    * Use controlled setbacks to rehearse your reactions. When you succumb to procrastinate because of anxiety or fear, alert yourself you now have an alternative option to control your fear and enhance your sense of achievements, hence you can better get rid of procrastinating.
    * To test yourself use a **planned setback**:
        1. Choose a project on which you are likely to procrastinate.
        2. Notice the warning signs of procrastination associated with this project.
        3. Consciously choose to procrastinate for a few hours to observe the self-statements that lead to guilt and self-criticism.
        4. Notice how this process of self-criticism leads to guilt, depression, and resentment.
    * Your planned setback will point you out when you are most likely to procrastinate. You now know where your former habits lead. Your knowledge of the guilt, frustration, and dissatisfaction that result from your former pattern can motivate you to use your new skills at guilt-free play, the Unschedule, and working in the flow state.
    * Use your planned setback as an instant replay, observing your thoughts as if from a distance as you "wire in" the corrective Now Habit technique every time you spot a symptom of counterproductive thinking and action.
        1. Notice how the challenging self-statements of a producer leeds to feeling of power and to focusing what you can do in manageable chunks.
        2. Use the Unschedule to put these strategies into operation, by creating a realistic picture of the time available this week, assured guilt-free play, rewards for doable periods of quality work, and a system for building on what you are achieving.
        3. Use the focusing exercise to help you rapidly and efficiently make the transition from overwhelmed to focused by accessing your deeper, creative self; taking time to remind yourself of positive suggestions and visualizations; and focusing in the present with choice, motivation, and interest.

### Resilience and Hardiness

* ✅ **Resilience**: the ability to _bounce back_
    * Anytime you commit yourself to new behavior, you can expect some setbacks. But the setbacks should not be a excuse to procrastinate.
    * Avoid self-criticism about setbacks or obstacles that appear in the middle of your project.
    * Sticking with the mission while adjusting to negative feedback is an essential skill in the repertoire of the long-term performer.
* ✅ **Hardiness**: the ability to _withstand and avoid pitfalls_
    * To build hardiness into the way you cope with work projects, you can practice attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge in leisure activities such as exercise.
    * Focusing solely on the goal is exhausting, and maintaining inflexible goals makes it harder to proceed.
    * To achieve goals that require enormous effort, you should _start from the small steps_ you could take, notice your change in perspective and feelings, and focus on the process of achieving the goal rather than the goal itself.

### Concentration: Controlling Distractions

* ❗ Overcoming procrastination while in the midst of a setback can be complicated by an inability to concentrate.
* ❗ Some distractions require your immediate attention; others could be handled after you complete some type of quality work.
* ❗ There are at least five types of distractions, and you have certain strategies to deal with these distractions:
    1. **Strong emotions**
        * Deserves your immediate attention.
        * Think through and write down what you could do to cope with such situations or change it, or seek support from friends.
    2. **Warnings of danger**
        * Rethink of the pressure messages you give to yourself, and always remember that you have alternative options.
        * Create a coping plan and a safety net, to get rid of your sense of worrying about imagined catastrophes.
    3. **"To-do" reminders**
        * Write down you to-dos and deal with them later, after you complete at least one-half hour of quality work.
    4. **Escape fantasies**
        * Work on short, tolerable periods of work and making sure you have rewards and social events to look forward to on your Unschedule to minimize this type of distraction.
    5. **UFOs – unidentified flights of originality**
        * Creative and often seductive thoughts usually are not useful to you while you complete quality work.
        * Let them fly away or undisturbed, or write them down so you may later reconsider them if you wish.
* ✅ By identifying and recording distractions, you'll be keeping interruptions to a minimum. And because you know that the distractions will be dealt with soon if they're important, you'll be able to stay relaxed enough to concentrate on doing quality work on your current project.

### Mental Rehearsal and Pre-Programming

* ✅ You will have given your mind a picture it can grasp and a message it can cooperate with. It will draw you to the place you imagined for your chosen work.

### Effective Goal-Setting

* ✅ Set realistic goals.
    * Let go of goals that could not be achieved or started in the near future.
    * To set realistic goals you must be willing to fully commit to working on the _path_ to that goal and be capable of investing the time and energy required to start now.
    * _You are the master of your goals._ Do not let unrealistic goals be used as an occasion for self-criticism and for lapsing into identifying yourself as a procrastinator.
* **Avoiding setbacks**
    * ✅ Setting a goal will require you to steer your activities in one direction, within a prescribed time period, along a path of challenges that will remind you of your human limits and frailties.
    * ✅ Three steps to apply the Now Habit and set goals effectively:
        1. Recognize the work of procrastinating.
        2. Freely choose the entire goal.
        3. Create functional, observable goals.

## Chapter 9: The Procrastination in Your Life

### Managing People Who Procrastinate

* Effective managers can better control procrastination by being mindful of the counterproductive self-talks of the procrastinators themselves, so that they are prepared to counter their unproductive focus and stimulate their energy towards results.
* ❗ **The ability to communicate in the language, images, and emotions that evoke understanding, inspiration, and direction in the governed is the hallmark of effective leadership.** The effective manager, coach, or leader can empathize with the various learning styles and emotional perspectives of the governed.
* ❗ To work effectively with procrastinators – and that means most people – managers must keep in mind the **three issues** that are the foundations of procrastination: feeling like a victim, being overwhelmed, and the fear of failure.

### Commitment vs. Compliance

* _Commitment_ to a task sparks much more creativity and motivation than _compliance_. Management through compliance places a heavy burden on the manager to maintain sufficient authority and force to have workers acquiesce to orders without question.
* ✅ Allowing employees to participate in decision that affect their work and give them choices on how they carry out orders will provide them a sense of commitment.

### Focusing on Starting vs. Finishing

* ❗ Anxiety often come from large or important tasks, the distant deadlines, and the enormity of work required to accomplish them.
* ✅ Effective managers communicate employees the specific action steps to begin a task. They also take time to ascertain the possible causes of blocks: wasting time trying to be perfect, being overwhelmed by trying to tackle the entire task, failing to create a three-dimensional schedule of the sub-goals, and a clear image of when and where to start.

### Getting Results or Giving Criticism

* ✅ Guidelines for managers to improve productivity and avoid actions that lead to procrastination:
    1. State your priorities clearly
    2. Be decisive
    3. Be fair and frequent in your rewards
    4. Give constructive feedback

### Living with a Procrastinator

* Though the procrastination patterns of a loved one may directly affect you, it is important that you not take them as personal affronts. Dealing with perfectionism, fear of failure and success, and the other underlying causes of procrastination makes it extremely difficult for most procrastinators to maintain a realistic idea of how much time it will take for them to complete a task.
* On the other hand, the procrastinators shouldn't take it personally if you leave exactly when you say you're going to leave rather than waiting for them. You might explain how, through no real fault of your own, you are rather neurotic about being on time. You hope they understand and forgive you your little obsession, but it is better for your relationship with them if you can leave when you say you're going to leave.
* ✅ Develop a sensibility to each other's priorities.
* ✅ Use the Now Habit strategies to clarify your communication and demonstrate for them the quality work and guilt-free play of a producer.

### A Last Word

* ✅ Experiment with the techniques presented throughout this book.
* ✅ Fine-tune them to fit your personal style and your situation.
* ✅ Stay open to change, with the assurance that you have the new tools of the Now Habit to replace old procrastination patterns and underachievement.
* ✅ Avoid statements such as "I'll try it" or "It's not working," which reveal a testing attitude rather than a firm commitment.

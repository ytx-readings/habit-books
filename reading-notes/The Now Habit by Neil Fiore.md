## Introduction

* **The vicious cycle**:

    > **get overwhelmed** → feel pressured → fear failure → try harder → work longer → feel resentful → lose motivation → **procrastinate**

    * Starts with the pressure of **feeling overwhelmed**
    * Ends with **procrastination** – the attempt to **escape the pressure**
    * Cannot enjoy the recuperative and creative benefits of guilt-free leisure time; time on playing or most enjoyable work feels like uneasy shrinking of what you _should_ be doing
* **A new definition of procrastination:**

    > Procrastination is a mechanism for **coping with the anxiety** associated with starting or completing any task or decision.
* **The Now Habit**: put aside the fear of failure, the terror of feeling overwhelmed and low self-esteem, and focus on your mind on what you can start _now_.
    * Core idea: **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life**
        * **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life** can attack the underlying causes of procrastination by **lowering resentment toward work**, **making it easier to start working**, **improving the quality of work**, and **stirring motivation**.
    * **Ten powerful tools to use:**
        1. Creating safety
        2. Reprogramming negative attitudes through positive self-talk
        3. Using the symptom to trigger the cure
        4. Guilt-free play
        5. Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar
        6. Making worry work for you
        7. The Unschedule
        8. Setting realistic goals
        9. Working in the flow state
        10. Controlled setbacks

## Chapter 1: Why We Procrastinate

### Warning signs of procrastination

1. Long series of obligations that cannot be met
2. Unrealistic about time
3. Vague about goals and values
4. Unfulfilled, frustrated, depressed
5. Indecisive and afraid of being criticized for mistakes
6. Low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness

### Why we procrastinate

* ❌ Procrastination is not from laziness, disorganization or other character defect.
* ✅ Procrastination is a mechanism **self-defending**: the **fear of failure**, the **fear of being imperfect (perfectionism)**, and the **fear of impossible expectations (being overwhelmed)** that prevent us from acting on and attaining humanly possible goals and relationships.

### Our worst critics are ourselves

* In childhood we are often criticized that we are _ever good enough_. We faced criticism or constructive feedback for parents.
* This leeds to low self-esteem and negative attitudes towards work.
* ✅ We have to reconstruct our confidence and get rid of our worst critic: _ourselves_. By doing this we can lessen resistance to authority, fear of failure, perfectionism, and fear of success.

### Procrastination is rewarding

* ❗ Many ways delaying is used to solve problems:
    * Make postponed tasks completed by someone else
    * Hesitant on buying something – the item is eventually going on sale or going out of style
    * Procrastination often goes unpunished
    * Cool down to avoid serious arguments with parents, teachers, bosses, and friends
    * Difficult problems often resolve by themselves if you wait for additional information of allow opportunities to pass
* ❗ The pernicious cycle:

    > Perfectionistic demands lead to → fear of failure → **procrastination** → self-criticism → anxiety and depression → loss of confidence → greater fear of failure which leads to → stronger need to use **procrastination** as a temporary escape

    * We are reluctant to face challenges and take risks without self-protective defenses. If you believe that a judgment of your work is a judgment of you, then perfectionism, self-criticism, and procrastination are necessary forms of **protection**.
    * We can become addicted to the rewards of procrastination, and use it in three main ways:
        1. as an indirect way of resisting pressure from authorities;
        2. as a way of lessening fear of failure by providing an excuse for a disappointing, less-than-perfect performance;
        3. and as a defense against fear of success by keeping us from doing our best.
* ❗ Procrastination is usually not the problem itself, but rather a symptom of other underlying problems.
    * **Procrastination can express resentment**
        * You are aware of the consequence of anger and punishment from powerful authorities.
        * If you are in a one-down position — a student, a subordinate, a private in the army — procrastination may be the safest way to exercise some power and control over your life.
    * **Procrastination is often used against fear of failure**
        * If you maintain extremely high standards for your performance and are critical of your mistakes, you will need to defend yourself from risky projects where the chances of failure are high.
        * Perfectionism and self-criticism are, in fact, the chief causes of fear of failure.
    * **Procrastination is often used to keep you from facing your fear of success**
        * Fear of success involves three central issues:
            1. **Conflict**: you find yourself in conflict over the awful choice between advancement and friends;
            2. **Disincentives**: success in completing a project means facing some painful disincentives to success, such as moving, looking for a new job, or paying back student loans; and
            3. **Delayed Fear of Failure**: success means advancement to increasing demands and a fear of ultimate failure sometime in the future.
        * You will reach a point where you can no longer make yourself do what you've been telling yourself you have to do to maintain success. **Your motivation had dried up. You can't seem to push yourself anymore.**
* **Procrastination is learned, and can be unlearned.** To unlearn procrastination, you need to:
    * Understand underlying causes of procrastination;
    * Develop alternative tools to cope with your fears, make work less painful and less depriving;
    * Make work more enjoyable, and make the quality and pleasure of leisure time greater than what you can ever achieve by procrastinating.

## Chapter 2: How We Procrastinate

### Knowing how you spent your time

* ✅ Observe where your time is going. Record the amount of time spent on your work and life. Create a schedule.
* ✅ Categorize your activities:
    * A: Most important
    * B: Important
    * C: Least important
* ❗ Urgent things are not always the best uses of our time.
* ✅ Keep recording for a few days so that you have a better estimate on how you spent on your time. Review how you spent your time. Then you can find areas of improvement – reducing time on unimportant activities.
    * Example: Get out of bed immediately; spend less time on breakfast; eliminate time spent on TV in the morning and evening when you are pressed for time.
    * Example: If you are a person taking long time to "settle in" before getting started, make conscious choices when you enter the office in the morning.
* ❗ Most of the time you spent are not directly related to high-priority tasks. Look for areas of improvement and gain greater control over interruptions and lost time.

### Procrastination logs

* ❗Keeping a record of how you spent your time will alert you how you inefficiently used your time, but it will not provide cues for you in actual work situation that need a change in your focus if you want to avoid falling back to your old behavior.
* ❗By _recording_ your current behavior and thoughts, you can know where to take corrective actions. Otherwise you are unable to learn from your past mistakes. The **procrastination log** provides as system that is easier for you to gain control of your time and your behavior patterns.
* ❗Your procrastination log can alert you to the _types_ of situations in which you are most likely to procrastinate. Examples:
    1. Detail activities
    2. Home chores
    3. Performance tasks
    4. Big or dense projects
* ✅ Identify the fears and pressures you typically associate with certain types of projects. The procrastination logs can show you how it helps or hinders your goal achievement. Awareness of the inner dialogue about how it connects to your procrastination patterns will let you make use of the now habit strategy.

### Creating safety: the first major step out of procrastination

* ❗ Your mind often changes when you face some kind of danger, depending on whether the danger is immediate and real or just possible. Procrastination usually occurs when you use fear to cover up yourself from the pressure of a real deadline.
* ❗ Procrastination and anxiety works in five stages:
    1. You give a task or a goal the power to determine your worth and happiness;
    2. You use perfectionism to put yourself in a situation where a single mistake will result in the _end of the world_;
    3. You find yourself of _frozen with anxiety_;
    4. You then use procrastination to escape the dilemma between _the immediate, and frightening_ **fear of failure** when doing the work, and the _higher level of anxiety_ from **time pressure of deadlines**;
    5. You then use a **real threat** such as fire or deadline to release yourself and perfectionism and to act as a motivator.

> If you maintain perfectionist standards, then failing to achieve your goals or making a mistake can feel as if you're going to die. But maybe your job, your relationship, or your home is so important to you that losing it would feel like the end of the world. If so, you'll want to know how to create alternatives that allow you to bounce back from your natural procrastination patterns.
>
> **In order to maximize your performance in a stressful world, you must create a protected and indisputable sense of worth for yourself.** Until you do, energy and concentration will be drained from work and put into preparing for imagined threats to your survival, and into procrastination as a means of coping.
>
> If you are threatening yourself with self-hatred and a life of unhappiness unless you achieve your goal, it's impossible to concentrate on the work in front of you now. **You must have some sort of protection from these self-imposed threats. Your healthy survival response (commonly thought of as stress) will not stop until you are safe.** You need a commitment to yourself and your innate worth that lets you know that, in spite of any failures, you believe in yourself enough to **try again, to get back on this board** – or some other board more suited to your unique talents.

## Chapter 3: How to Talk to Yourself

### Counterproductive messages

* ❗ When we speak to ourselves in an authoritarian voice, it indicates that we feel pressure to do something, and that while one part of ourselves is applying the pressure, the other part does not want to do it. Such self-alienation and subconscious message of such self-talk leads to inner conflict and procrastination of ourselves.
* ✅ To heal self-alienation and inner conflict between the authoritarian voice and rebel, we have to learn a language that removes such conflict and gains power over ourselves.
* Counterproductive messages drive you away from the positive direction towards what you _want, decide, or choose_ to do.
    * ❌ Counterproductive messages:
        * **The "have to's"** – messages of stress
            * You don't want to do something and you feel that external forces are pushing you towards doing them.
            * A "have to" statement communicates to your subconscious mind:

                > * I don't want to do it.
                > * They're making me do it against my will.
                > * I have to do it or else!—something awful and terrible will happen. I will hate myself.
                > * This is a no-win situation: if I don't do it I'll be punished; if I do it I'll be going against myself.
            * You are stuck _mentally, physically, and emotionally_ when you face the confusion of the "have to" message, as you brain provides energy both to the imposed task and to resist threats to the integrity of yourself.
        * **The "should's"** – messages of depression
            * You feel angry and disappointed about the situation, and you complain and feel badly.
            * Self-critical comparisons:

                | Criticism | Compares | With |
                |-----------|----------|------|
                | **Should be different** | An imagined ideal state | A current negative reality |
                | **Should be done** | The finished point | A bad or negative starting point |
                | **Should be like him/her** | A person you envy or admire | A bad, inadequate self |
                | **Should be there** | An imagined blissful future | Where you are now |

    * ❌ "Have to's: and "should do's" do not communicate to the mind and body a clear picture of:

        > * _What you choose_ to do
        > * _When you choose_ to do it
        > * _Where you choose_ to start it
        > * _How you choose_ to do it
* ✅ As you speak to yourself in a language focusing on results rather than blame, on choice rather than _have to_, on _what is_ rather than what you think _should be_, you feel that your mind and body cooperate by providing positive energy that release you from the unnecessary struggles of the past and negative comparisons with the future.

### The Power of Choice

* ✅ **From resistance to commitment**
    * You don't have to _want_ or _love_ to do the task, but if you prefer it to the consequences of not doing it, you can decide to _commit_ it wholeheartedly.
    * ✅ **Since you made a mature commitment to the task rather than arguing against it, you may as well be self-nurturing to make it as pleasant as possible.**
* ✅ **Learning how to say no**
    * For procrastinators, saying "no" is a powerful tool for exercising choice.
    * "No" can be used assertively and non-defensively:

        > * "No, I'll need time to think about that."
        > * "No, I am not as quick as you, and I want time to give it the thoughtful consideration it deserves."
        > * "No, I would rather have a contract with terms I know I can wholeheartedly embrace than endanger the quality of my work by compromising."
        > * "No, I will not be paying that bill now, and I'm willing to pay for the privilege by incurring your interest charges."
    * ✅ **Developing fresh alternative self-statements that involve choice, commitment, and the ability to say no is an essential step toward having a greater range of possibilities in working on any task and in changing from a procrastinator to an effective producer.**

### Five self-statements that distinguish procrastinators from producers

* ✅ As you switch from the old, negative thinkings to the new and positive thinkings, the old ones will atrophy, and the new ones will become strengthen and easier to start with.
* ✅ Practice shifting to the effective self-talks of producers. You can place them everywhere most visible and accessible to you.

    | # | Negative thinking of… | → | Replace with… |
    |---|-----------------------|---|---------------|
    | 1 | "I have to" | → | "I choose to" |
    | 2 | "I must finish" | → | "When can I start?" |
    | 3 | "This project is so big and important" | → | "I can take one small step" |
    | 4 | "I must be perfect" | → | "I can be perfectly human" |
    | 5 | "I don't have time to play" | → | "I must take time to play" |

## Chapter 4: Guilt-Free Play, Quality Work

* Most tragic form of procrastination – **putting off living**
    * ❌ Keeps us from completing the most important tasks in life;
    * ❌ Lessens our respect for ourselves by keeping use in destructive, delaying tactics such as overeating, excessive TV watching, the investment of time and money in a succession of halfhearted and rapidly abandoned hobbies and schemes.
* ❗ Both workaholics and procrastinators tend to:
    * See themselves as always **burdened by incomplete work**
    * Thinking the lives of themselves as "**being on hold**" hoping that someday they will be organized enough to enjoy life
    * View human beings as lazy and requiring pressure in order to create motivation
    * Maintain negative attitudes toward work
* ❗ **Both workaholics and procrastinators are either working or feeling guilty about not working.**

### The importance of play

* **Guilt-free play** is essential to attaining quality work and minimizing procrastination. When you apply this strategy, you learn to _play more and complete more quality work_.
* ❌ Long-term procrastinators _suffered more_ when they take a long time to complete their work. They:
    * Saw themselves as always working
    * Thought of their lives as "being on hold"
    * Felt that work required deprivation and sacrifice
    * Felt guilty if they spent time with their friends or in leisure activities
* ✅ On the other hand, those who made good progress and completed their goals timely were dedicated and committed to their _leisure time_.
    * They had to swim, run, or dance almost every day.
    * They met with friends frequently on dinners.
    * They _recreate_ themselves to keep them motivated and interested in returning to their projects.
* ❗ One reason we procrastinate is that we fear the we have no time to play once we start working, and that work will deprive us of the pleasure of play and the enjoyment of life. **Guilt-free play offers you an alternative way that it insists you to schedule recreation time in your weekly schedule. Making play a priority in your life is an important way to overcome procrastination and to enjoy life more.**
* ❗ Adults usually think of play as being separate from learning and work. But play is an essential part of every child's development and learning about work, **allowing them to learn the physical, mental and social skills necessary for adult life**.
* ✅ **Guilt-free play can revive your early excitement about learning, problem-solving, and participating in challenging activities.**

### The pull method of self-motivation

* ❗ **Push method** – stimulate actions through fear and punishment.
    * Action produced by punishment does not directed towards the goal, but directed towards escaping the fear.
    * The push method assumes that humans are lazy and scaring the hell out of them may create motivation.
* ✅ **Pull method** – stimulate actions through rewards and achievements.
    * The pull method assumes that we are naturally inquisitive, and if we are properly rewarded for our efforts we can persevere with even the most difficult tasks.
    * The pull method recognize that _distant and indefinite_ rewards have very little power to motivate a person to continually face difficult, overwhelming tasks.
    * ❗ There is a low chance you will start working on a task if the immediate results are isolation and pain, and the rewards are distant and uncertain. Chances of choosing this kind of activities are even slimmer.
    * ✅ Finding some time to do things you really love to do can lessen the sense of burden and deprivation from working.

### From guilt-free play to quality work

* ✅ **Enjoying guilt-free play leads to you to higher levels of quality, creative work.**
* Once you have completed some quality work, your feeling of self-control increases, and your capacity to enjoy _quality, guilt-free play_ grows. The seeds of earlier work also flourish subconsciously into new ideas and breakthroughs. You then become better rested, inspired, and ready for _greater quality work_.
* As you include guilt-free play among your tools for overcoming procrastination, you will find that insights come to you throughout your day.
* ✅ Emphasizing the importance of play does not deny the need of work and perseverance. It recognizes the importance of work, but it also recognizes play as a _commitment to a mission_ that focuses your energies and brings about inner harmony, a commitment that comes from a pull _toward_ a goal, and an excitement about the process of getting there.

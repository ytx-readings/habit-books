## Introduction

* **The vicious cycle**:

    > **get overwhelmed** → feel pressured → fear failure → try harder → work longer → feel resentful → lose motivation → **procrastinate**

    * Starts with the pressure of **feeling overwhelmed**
    * Ends with **procrastination** – the attempt to **escape the pressure**
    * Cannot enjoy the recuperative and creative benefits of guilt-free leisure time; time on playing or most enjoyable work feels like uneasy shrinking of what you _should_ be doing
* **A new definition of procrastination:**

    > Procrastination is a mechanism for **coping with the anxiety** associated with starting or completing any task or decision.
* **The Now Habit**: put aside the fear of failure, the terror of feeling overwhelmed and low self-esteem, and focus on your mind on what you can start _now_.
    * Core idea: **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life**
        * **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life** can attack the underlying causes of procrastination by **lowering resentment toward work**, **making it easier to start working**, **improving the quality of work**, and **stirring motivation**.
    * **Ten powerful tools to use:**
        1. Creating safety
        2. Reprogramming negative attitudes through positive self-talk
        3. Using the symptom to trigger the cure
        4. Guilt-free play
        5. Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar
        6. Making worry work for you
        7. The Unschedule
        8. Setting realistic goals
        9. Working in the flow state
        10. Controlled setbacks

## Chapter 1: Why We Procrastinate

### Warning signs of procrastination

1. Long series of obligations that cannot be met
2. Unrealistic about time
3. Vague about goals and values
4. Unfulfilled, frustrated, depressed
5. Indecisive and afraid of being criticized for mistakes
6. Low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness

### Why we procrastinate

* ❌ Procrastination is not from laziness, disorganization or other character defect.
* ✅ Procrastination is a mechanism **self-defending**: the **fear of failure**, the **fear of being imperfect (perfectionism)**, and the **fear of impossible expectations (being overwhelmed)** that prevent us from acting on and attaining humanly possible goals and relationships.

### Our worst critics are ourselves

* In childhood we are often criticized that we are _ever good enough_. We faced criticism or constructive feedback for parents.
* This leeds to low self-esteem and negative attitudes towards work.
* ✅ We have to reconstruct our confidence and get rid of our worst critic: _ourselves_. By doing this we can lessen resistance to authority, fear of failure, perfectionism, and fear of success.

### Procrastination is rewarding

* Many ways delaying is used to solve problems:
    * Make postponed tasks completed by someone else
    * Hesitant on buying something – the item is eventually going on sale or going out of style
    * Procrastination often goes unpunished
    * Cool down to avoid serious arguments with parents, teachers, bosses, and friends
    * Difficult problems often resolve by themselves if you wait for additional information of allow opportunities to pass
* The pernicious cycle:

    > Perfectionistic demands lead to → fear of failure → **procrastination** → self-criticism → anxiety and depression → loss of confidence → greater fear of failure which leads to → stronger need to use **procrastination** as a temporary escape

    * We are reluctant to face challenges and take risks without self-protective defenses. If you believe that a judgment of your work is a judgment of you, then perfectionism, self-criticism, and procrastination are necessary forms of **protection**.
    * We can become addicted to the rewards of procrastination, and use it in three main ways:
        1. as an indirect way of resisting pressure from authorities;
        2. as a way of lessening fear of failure by providing an excuse for a disappointing, less-than-perfect performance;
        3. and as a defense against fear of success by keeping us from doing our best.
* Procrastination is usually not the problem itself, but rather a symptom of other underlying problems.
    * **Procrastination can express resentment**
        * You are aware of the consequence of anger and punishment from powerful authorities.
        * If you are in a one-down position — a student, a subordinate, a private in the army — procrastination may be the safest way to exercise some power and control over your life.
    * **Procrastination is often used against fear of failure**
        * If you maintain extremely high standards for your performance and are critical of your mistakes, you will need to defend yourself from risky projects where the chances of failure are high.
        * Perfectionism and self-criticism are, in fact, the chief causes of fear of failure.
    * **Procrastination is often used to keep you from facing your fear of success**
        * Fear of success involves three central issues:
            1. **Conflict**: you find yourself in conflict over the awful choice between advancement and friends;
            2. **Disincentives**: success in completing a project means facing some painful disincentives to success, such as moving, looking for a new job, or paying back student loans; and
            3. **Delayed Fear of Failure**: success means advancement to increasing demands and a fear of ultimate failure sometime in the future.
        * You will reach a point where you can no longer make yourself do what you've been telling yourself you have to do to maintain success. **Your motivation had dried up. You can't seem to push yourself anymore.**
* **Procrastination is learned, and can be unlearned.** To unlearn procrastination, you need to:
    * Understand underlying causes of procrastination;
    * Develop alternative tools to cope with your fears, make work less painful and less depriving;
    * Make work more enjoyable, and make the quality and pleasure of leisure time greater than what you can ever achieve by procrastinating.

## Chapter 2: How We Procrastinate

### Knowing how you spent your time

* Observe where your time is going. Record the amount of time spent on your work and life. Create a schedule.
* Categorize your activities:
    * A: Most important
    * B: Important
    * C: Least important
* Urgent things are not always the best uses of our time.
* Keep recording for a few days so that you have a better estimate on how you spent on your time. Review how you spent your time. Then you can find areas of improvement – reducing time on unimportant activities.
    * Example: Get out of bed immediately; spend less time on breakfast; eliminate time spent on TV in the morning and evening when you are pressed for time.
    * Example: If you are a person taking long time to "settle in" before getting started, make conscious choices when you enter the office in the morning.
* Most of the time you spent are not directly related to high-priority tasks. Look for areas of improvement and gain greater control over interruptions and lost time.

### Procrastination logs

* Keeping a record of how you spent your time will alert you how you inefficiently used your time, but it will not provide cues for you in actual work situation that need a change in your focus if you want to avoid falling back to your old behavior.
* By _recording_ your current behavior and thoughts, you can know where to take corrective actions. Otherwise you are unable to learn from your past mistakes. The **procrastination log** provides as system that is easier for you to gain control of your time and your behavior patterns.
* Your procrastination log can alert you to the _types_ of situations in which you are most likely to procrastinate. Examples:
    1. Detail activities
    2. Home chores
    3. Performance tasks
    4. Big or dense projects
* Identify the fears and pressures you typically associate with certain types of projects. The procrastination logs can show you how it helps or hinders your goal achievement. Awareness of the inner dialogue about how it connects to your procrastination patterns will let you make use of the now habit strategy.

### Creating safety: the first major step out of procrastination

* Your mind often changes when you face some kind of danger, depending on whether the danger is immediate and real or just possible. Procrastination usually occurs when you use fear to cover up yourself from the pressure of a real deadline.
* Procrastination and anxiety works in five stages:
    1. You give a task or a goal the power to determine your worth and happiness;
    2. You use perfectionism to put yourself in a situation where a single mistake will result in the _end of the world_;
    3. You find yourself of _frozen with anxiety_;
    4. You then use procrastination to escape the dilemma between _the immediate, and frightening_ **fear of failure** when doing the work, and the _higher level of anxiety_ from **time pressure of deadlines**;
    5. You then use a **real threat** such as fire or deadline to release yourself and perfectionism and to act as a motivator.

> If you maintain perfectionist standards, then failing to achieve your goals or making a mistake can feel as if you're going to die. But maybe your job, your relationship, or your home is so important to you that losing it would feel like the end of the world. If so, you'll want to know how to create alternatives that allow you to bounce back from your natural procrastination patterns.
>
> **In order to maximize your performance in a stressful world, you must create a protected and indisputable sense of worth for yourself.** Until you do, energy and concentration will be drained from work and put into preparing for imagined threats to your survival, and into procrastination as a means of coping.
>
> If you are threatening yourself with self-hatred and a life of unhappiness unless you achieve your goal, it's impossible to concentrate on the work in front of you now. **You must have some sort of protection from these self-imposed threats. Your healthy survival response (commonly thought of as stress) will not stop until you are safe.** You need a commitment to yourself and your innate worth that lets you know that, in spite of any failures, you believe in yourself enough to **try again, to get back on this board** – or some other board more suited to your unique talents.

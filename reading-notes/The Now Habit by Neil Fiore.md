## Introduction

* **The vicious cycle**: **get overwhelmed** → feel pressured → fear failure → try harder → work longer → feel resentful → lose motivation → **procrastinate**
    * Starts with the pressure of **feeling overwhelmed**
    * Ends with **procrastination** – the attempt to **escape the pressure**
    * Cannot enjoy the recuperative and creative benefits of guilt-free leisure time; time on playing or most enjoyable work feels like uneasy shrinking of what you _should_ be doing
* **A new definition of procrastination:**

    > Procrastination is a mechanism for **coping with the anxiety** associated with starting or completing any task or decision.
* **The Now Habit**: put aside the fear of failure, the terror of feeling overwhelmed and low self-esteem, and focus on your mind on what you can start _now_.
    * Core idea: **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life**
        * **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life** can attack the underlying causes of procrastination by **lowering resentment toward work**, **making it easier to start working**, **improving the quality of work**, and **stirring motivation**.

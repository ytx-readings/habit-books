## Introduction

* **The vicious cycle**:

    > **get overwhelmed** → feel pressured → fear failure → try harder → work longer → feel resentful → lose motivation → **procrastinate**

    * Starts with the pressure of **feeling overwhelmed**
    * Ends with **procrastination** – the attempt to **escape the pressure**
    * Cannot enjoy the recuperative and creative benefits of guilt-free leisure time; time on playing or most enjoyable work feels like uneasy shrinking of what you _should_ be doing
* **A new definition of procrastination:**

    > Procrastination is a mechanism for **coping with the anxiety** associated with starting or completing any task or decision.
* **The Now Habit**: put aside the fear of failure, the terror of feeling overwhelmed and low self-esteem, and focus on your mind on what you can start _now_.
    * Core idea: **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life**
        * **Scheduling more guilt-free play in your life** can attack the underlying causes of procrastination by **lowering resentment toward work**, **making it easier to start working**, **improving the quality of work**, and **stirring motivation**.
    * **Ten powerful tools to use:**
        1. Creating safety
        2. Reprogramming negative attitudes through positive self-talk
        3. Using the symptom to trigger the cure
        4. Guilt-free play
        5. Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar
        6. Making worry work for you
        7. The Unschedule
        8. Setting realistic goals
        9. Working in the flow state
        10. Controlled setbacks

## Chapter 1: Why We Procrastinate

### Warning signs of procrastination

1. Long series of obligations that cannot be met
2. Unrealistic about time
3. Vague about goals and values
4. Unfulfilled, frustrated, depressed
5. Indecisive and afraid of being criticized for mistakes
6. Low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness

### Why we procrastinate

* ❌ Procrastination is not from laziness, disorganization or other character defect.
* ✅ Procrastination is a mechanism **self-defending**: the **fear of failure**, the **fear of being imperfect (perfectionism)**, and the **fear of impossible expectations (being overwhelmed)** that prevent us from acting on and attaining humanly possible goals and relationships.

### Our worst critics are ourselves

* In childhood we are often criticized that we are _ever good enough_. We faced criticism or constructive feedback for parents.
* This leeds to low self-esteem and negative attitudes towards work.
* ✅ We have to reconstruct our confidence and get rid of our worst critic: _ourselves_. By doing this we can lessen resistance to authority, fear of failure, perfectionism, and fear of success.

### Procrastination is rewarding

* Many ways delaying is used to solve problems:
    * Make postponed tasks completed by someone else
    * Hesitant on buying something – the item is eventually going on sale or going out of style
    * Procrastination often goes unpunished
    * Cool down to avoid serious arguments with parents, teachers, bosses, and friends
    * Difficult problems often resolve by themselves if you wait for additional information of allow opportunities to pass
* The pernicious cycle:

    > Perfectionistic demands lead to → fear of failure → **procrastination** → self-criticism → anxiety and depression → loss of confidence → greater fear of failure which leads to → stronger need to use **procrastination** as a temporary escape

    * We are reluctant to face challenges and take risks without self-protective defenses. If you believe that a judgment of your work is a judgment of you, then perfectionism, self-criticism, and procrastination are necessary forms of **protection**.
    * We can become addicted to the rewards of procrastination, and use it in three main ways:
        1. as an indirect way of resisting pressure from authorities;
        2. as a way of lessening fear of failure by providing an excuse for a disappointing, less-than-perfect performance;
        3. and as a defense against fear of success by keeping us from doing our best.
* Procrastination is usually not the problem itself, but rather a symptom of other underlying problems.
    * **Procrastination can express resentment**
        * You are aware of the consequence of anger and punishment from powerful authorities.
        * If you are in a one-down position — a student, a subordinate, a private in the army — procrastination may be the safest way to exercise some power and control over your life.
    * **Procrastination is often used against fear of failure**
        * If you maintain extremely high standards for your performance and are critical of your mistakes, you will need to defend yourself from risky projects where the chances of failure are high.
        * Perfectionism and self-criticism are, in fact, the chief causes of fear of failure.
    * **Procrastination is often used to keep you from facing your fear of success**
        * Fear of success involves three central issues:
            1. **Conflict**: you find yourself in conflict over the awful choice between advancement and friends;
            2. **Disincentives**: success in completing a project means facing some painful disincentives to success, such as moving, looking for a new job, or paying back student loans; and
            3. **Delayed Fear of Failure**: success means advancement to increasing demands and a fear of ultimate failure sometime in the future.
        * You will reach a point where you can no longer make yourself do what you've been telling yourself you have to do to maintain success. **Your motivation had dried up. You can't seem to push yourself anymore.**
* **Procrastination is learned, and can be unlearned.** To unlearn procrastination, you need to:
    * Understand underlying causes of procrastination;
    * Develop alternative tools to cope with your fears, make work less painful and less depriving;
    * Make work more enjoyable, and make the quality and pleasure of leisure time greater than what you can ever achieve by procrastinating.
